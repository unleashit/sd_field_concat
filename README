-------------------------------------------------------CCK FIELD PLUGIN FOR SEBLOD 2.0 CCK FOR JOOMLA 1.7.X-------------------------------------------------------Version: 2.1.5Name: SD Field ConcatAuthor: Simon Dowdles - www.onestuckpixel.comTwitter: @simondowdles--------------Description--------------Concatenates any cck fields, plain text values & limited pre-defined variables into one value. Ideal for unique titles--------------Instructions--------------> Plain text to appear in square brackets like [plain text here]. Fields enclosed with # like #field_name# and predefined variables like $date, $time, $username & $userid> Field Separator determines the character used to glue all values together. Use value 'ns' should you not want a separator. Default is a space.> You can specify the date format string, which accepts any valid PHP date() formatting syntax. Defaults to Y-m-d> Example: [Article created by]||$username||[on]||$date||[in category ID]||#art_catid#> Will result in: "Article created by Simon Dowdles on 2011-08-26 in category ID 9" where I would have used no field separator character, and therefore it defaulted to a space.> You can now have the values or labels of multiple checkboxes and multiple selects used as well, but REMEMBER to set the 'text' or 'value' option in the field configuration accordingly or you won't get any values returned. Enjoy!------------- Notes------------- > SD Field Concat now runs on Joomla! 2.5.1 with SEBLOD 2.2 and class names have been changed to reflect the new API of SEBLOD 2.2 ------------Contribute------------  If you'd like to contribute to this project, please request a fork, I'll be more than happy!
